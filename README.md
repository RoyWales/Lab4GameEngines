Here is my lab 4 exercise 2.
https://roywales.github.io/Lab4GameEngines/

I used an observer pattern to set up the audio source to play when the player touches the enemy symbolizing a punch. The observer pattern is set up in the punchscound script and used in the playercollision script. I used a singleton pattern to update the players health. The player loses 1 health when he hits the sharp edges of the spike in the ground. the singleton pattern is set up in the playerhealth script and used in the playercollision script.
